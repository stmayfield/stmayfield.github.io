# Application Development Portfolio

This responsive website has been coded, designed, and tested to utilize a variety of componenets and utilities found in Bootstrap 4.4. This website consists of 4 total web HTML pages with placeholder images and text for future portfolio projects and personal details. Each page is structured to allow for a fully functional and minimally styled navigational bar, a sticky footer with active href links to social media pages (styled with FontAwesome icons), and a contact form with a non-functional/dummy confirmation page.
