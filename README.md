# 02-CSS-Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio (Bootstrap)

This responsive website has been coded, designed, and tested to utilize a variety of componenets and utilities found in Bootstrap 4.4. This website consists of 4 total web HTML pages with placeholder images and text for future portfolio projects and personal details. Each page is structured to allow for a fully functional and minimally styled navigational bar, a sticky footer with active href links to social media pages (styled with FontAwesome icons), and a contact form with a non-functional/dummy confirmation page.

Due to some limitations of the hosting offered by GitPages, the relative filepath for the contact form element on "contact.html" is non functional and has instead been replaced with the live URL where the "contact_confirmation.html" page is currently hosted.
